# GEOMETRIC-LEARNING-FOR-FLOWS-IN-POROUS-SYSTEMS

\section{Aim and Objectives}
Consider a complex network (porous media, river basin, pipeline network) where fluid flow is governed by strict laws of physics and boundary condition unknown or difficult to calculate. Assuming either historical data is available with good precision or a limited number of snapshots can be calculated. The aim of this study is to reconstruct the state of fluid flow from real-time measurements obtained from a limited number of sensors located at particular points in the complex network. The objectives of this study are therefore:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reconstruct of the state of the system (from experimental measurements),
    \item Optimize the location of the gauges.
\end{itemize}
